// DESCRIPTION:
// Your friend has been out shopping for puppies (what a time to be alive!)... He arrives back with multiple dogs, and you simply do not know how to respond!
// By repairing the function provided, you will find out exactly how you should respond, depending on the number of dogs he has.
// The number of dogs will always be a number and there will always be at least 1 dog.
// SOLUTION:
// function howManyDalmatians(n){
  
//   let r = ["Hardly any", "More than a handful!", "Woah that's a lot of dogs!", "101 DALMATIANS!!!"]
//   return n <= 10 ? r[0]:n<=50?r[1]:n<=100?r[2]:r[3]
// }

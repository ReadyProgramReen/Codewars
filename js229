// Find the mean (average) of a list of numbers in an array.
// To find the mean (average) of a set of numbers add all of the numbers together and divide by the number of values in the list.
// Test.assertEquals(findAverage([1]), 1)
//     Test.assertEquals(findAverage([1, 3, 5, 7]), 4)


// Answer 1 : 
// var findAverage = function (nums) {

// return nums.reduce((a,c)=>a+c,0)/nums.length
// }
// explain> the question asked for the mean of the entire array, which required you to add each element and divide it by the length of he array . So i used reduce method (which sums an entire array ) and right after divided that sum by the length of the array.

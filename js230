// Replace all dots
// The code provided is supposed replace all the dots . in the specified String str with dashes -


// Answer 1 : 

// const replaceDots = function(str) {
// return str.split('.').join('-')     // to change the dots to a dashes , i used split method to cut them at the dots and join back with  dashes         
// }

// note : try to learn replace method to solve also

// QUESTION 7:

// Add Length
// What if we need the length of the words separated by a space to be added at the end of that same word and have it returned as an array?

// Example(Input --> Output)

// "apple ban" --> ["apple 5", "ban 3"]
// "you will win" -->["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]
// Your task is to write a function that takes a String and returns an Array/list with the length of each word added to each element .

// Note: String will have at least one element; words will always be separated by a space.


// Answer 1 : 
// function addLength(str) {

//   return str.split(" ").map(e=>`${e} ${e.length}`)

// }

// Explanation : for this problem the output needed to be an array of the first word and its length. So knowing that , you need to first turn the string to an array with split (" ") , keeping a space in the braket since you are spliting the elements by the space and not by each characer. Then since map creates a new array use map with a template literal and place the new array elements next to its elments lengths in each element
